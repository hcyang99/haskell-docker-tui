# Docker TUI

## A User Interface allowing operations on Docker Components

Idea originates from https://github.com/skanehira/docui with an implementation by Go.

Functions are as follows:
 - image

    - search/pull/remove
    - save/import/load
 
 - container
    - create/remove
    - start/stop/kill
    - export/commit
 
 The work flow is explained by the following images:
